# New Super Pablo Brawl 2.0

This is my very first project on Unity, a 2D platform game made in 2018 as a student project. Some additions, such as the Android port or the final boss, have been added later on just to try some Unity features.

## Gameplay 
You can find [here](https://youtu.be/jUrV5jjyFCo) a gameplay of this game.
## Team
We were a team of two people on this project : 
 - Romain Aury, who designed some of the assets (the biker villain, the
   house and the musics) 
  - Myself, who designed the other assets (except for the sky and the ground, that we took from the store), the scripts, and put it all together.
